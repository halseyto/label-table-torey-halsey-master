/* 
 * This is a driver to test pass1 and the Label Table functions.
 * It reads its input from a file if a filename has been passed as a command-line argument, or from the standard input otherwise.
 * It constructs a table of instruction labels and addresses from the input, where a label's address is determined by the address of its instruction.
 * Instructions are assumed to be 4 bytes long, with the first instruction starting at address 0.
 * Labels that appear anywhere but at the beginning of a line are ignored.
 *
 * For example, the following two lines of code would result in a table with one entry, indicating that label A_LABEL is at address 4.
 *
 *              add $t1, $t1, $t1   # This instruction is at address 0
 *    A_LABEL:  slt $t0, $t1, $t2   # This instruction is at address 4
 *              bne $t0, $zero, A_LABEL  # This instr. is at address 8
 *
 * USAGE:
 *      name [ filename ] [ 0|1 ]
 * where "name" is the name of the executable,
 *       "filename" is an optional file containing the input to read, and
 *       " 0" or "1" specifies that debugging should be turned off or on, respectively,
 *            regardless of any calls to debug_on, debug_off, or debug_restore in the program.
 * Both arguments are optional; if both are present they may appear in either order.
 * If no filename is provided, the program reads its input from stdin.
 * If no debugging choice is provided, the program prints debugging messages, or not, depending on indications in the code.
 *
 * INPUT:
 * This program expects the input to consist of lines of MIPS instructions, each of which may (or may not) contain a label at the beginning of the line.
 * The input should have one MIPS instruction on each line.
 * Labels should appear as the first token in the line, followed immediately by a colon.
 * Labels may also appear elsewhere in an instruction, but those labels are ignored by this program.
 *
 * OUTPUT:
 * The program prints the contents of the label table it has constructed.
 * For the example above, the output might look like:
 *      Label: A_LABEL   Address: 4
 * (The actual formatting depends on the implementation of the printLabels function in LabelTable.c.)
 *
 * ERROR CONDITIONS:
 * It is an error for the input to contain multiple instructions with the same label at the beginning of the line.
