# assembler-assignments: Assembler Assignments
##  Label Table Project, and <br> Assember

### Label Table Project
This repository contains most of the starter code (including a `Makefile`)
needed for the Label Table Project, in which students will write and
test functions that create and interact with a Label Table (useful for the
Assembler program to be written later).

This repository does *not* contain several utility functions for processing
command line arguments and printing error and debugging messages that were
included in the Disassembler Assignments repository.  You should copy the
following files from that repository to this one:
- `same.h`
- `process_arguments.h`
- `process_arguments.c`
- `printFuncs.c`
- `printError.c`
- `printDebug.c`
(Alternatively, you can download them from the project description page.)

(See [here](http://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs230/Projects/LabelTableProj.html)
for the project description for the Label Table program.)

### Assembler
The repository also contains some additional starter code for the
follow-up assembler program, including a small, initial test file and
its expected output.
(See [here](http://www.cs.kzoo.edu/cs230/Projects/AssemblerProj.html)
for the project description for the assembler program.)
